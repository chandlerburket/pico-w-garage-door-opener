# pico-w-garage-door-opener

This project utilizes a garage door opener using a raspberry pi pico w and micropython.

There are versions of this project done but I wanted tto run the microcontroller from the garage door button located in the garage to control the door.

The pico w hosts a website on the local network that you can press a single button for the door to go up, down, or stop.
